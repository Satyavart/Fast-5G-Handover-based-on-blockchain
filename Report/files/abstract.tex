\chapter*{\centering Abstract}

{
    The next generation mobile cellular communication
and networking system (5G) is highly flexible and heterogeneous.
It integrates different types of networks, such as 4G legacy
networks, Internet of Things (IoT), Vehicular Ad-hoc Network
(VANET) and Wireless Local Access Network (WLAN) to form
a heterogeneous network. This easily results in continual vertical
handovers between different networks. On the other hand,
substantial deployment of small/micro-cell Base Stations (BSs) brings
frequent horizontal handovers within a network. The continual
handovers among BSs and various networks expose Mobile
Equipment(ME) to risk of security and privacy threats.\\[1.5\baselineskip]

    Nevertheless, there still lacks a thorough algorithm for fast 
authentication of the ME during the handover which is invulnerable to 
attacks. In this project, I have worked on the algorithm that will  
authenticate the ME with secure and fast way furthermore verify the user with 
blockchain.
